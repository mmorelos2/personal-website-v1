          <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
          <p>
            I have a lot of experience writing software in C++ and Python in Texas A&M. I have mainly used
            C++ to implement data structures and understand how they work, while I have used Python to create
            scripts and some of my personal projects. Throughout the summer of 2022 I spent a lot of time developing
            websites and using new tools/frameworks that I found interesting. First, I learned how to use React with
            Redux to implement a calculator web application. This web application used Redux to more easily store
            the data inputted by the user into the calculator. I then proceeded to learn how to use Mongoose and MongoDB.
            I created a To-Do List web app that uses Mongoose and MongoDB to store user tasks and retrieve them. The
            user would be able to delete, edit, and create tasks to keep track of anything they have to do throughout
            the day. After experimenting using those tools and frameworks, I then proceeded to use Python to improve my
            skills when it comes to problem solving and implementing data structures, and I also learned how to use
            the PyGame library. Now I am currently using C++ in one of my courses at Texas A&M to implement parts
            of a computer system, and I am taking a course which lets you develop websites with a team of people.

          <h1>My Interest in Computer Science</h1>
          <p>
            My current area of interest in Computer Science lies in software engineering. I want to develop software
            that has a positive impact on the world. One of my interests is in Computer Vision, because you can use it
            to interact with the world in ways that have not been done before. We can create safer self-driving vehicles
            that will allow driverless cars to be a common thing in the future. We can create AI that is able to analyze and
            interpret images in real-time and interact with the world. This is interesting to me because it starts to incorporate
            technology into our daily lives more than ever, and I believe this will make a great positive change in our society
            if done correctly. My other interest is in creating websites. I find it interesting to be able to put out a
            resource online that many users can access and use to help them fulfill their needs.
